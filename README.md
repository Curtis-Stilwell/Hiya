Hiya – SwiftUI AI App

Hiya is a simple SwiftUI app created as part of a Udemy tutorial. The app demonstrates how to integrate AI into a SwiftUI project.

The app prompts the AI with the text “Say hi in a fun way.”. The AI then generates a response and displays it to the user in the app interface.

This project was built for learning purposes and focuses on SwiftUI fundamentals and basic AI interaction.
